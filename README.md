```
9 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) is equivalent to 6 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST).

EST and PST are time zones in the United States. EST is 5 hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and is observed in the Eastern Time Zone, which includes states such as New York, Florida, and Michigan. PST is 8 hours behind UTC and is observed in the Pacific Time Zone, which includes states such as California, Oregon, and Washington.

To convert a time from EST to PST, you can simply subtract 3 hours from the time. For example, 9 PM EST is equivalent to 6 PM PST.

You can use an online time zone converter tool or a smartphone app to easily convert between different time zones.
